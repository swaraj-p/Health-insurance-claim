Finding parameters affecting health insurance charges using regression analysis in Excel.  

Problem Statement:

An insurance company in the US is reviewing its insurance claims/charges and is trying to do a cause and effect analysis for future business decisions.This analysis would have a bearing on what premium should the company charge a customer availing an insurance policy.

Objective:
‚óè To do a cause and effect analysis on historic-data of insurance claims and perform the Exploratory Data Analysis on the data.

a) Identify the categorical and continuous variables

b) Make Histograms and box plots (univariate analysis) for continuous variables and do a
correlation analysis (multivariate analysis)

c) Make relevant Pivot tables and charts for:

I. Male/Female ratio and share information on which gender has more smokers

ii. Charges vs Age

iii. Charges vs BMI

iv. Charges for Smokers vs Non-smokers

d) Region-wise smokers vs Non-smokers analysis with one or more pivot table and charts

e) Region-wise charges for smokers vs non-smokers

f) Has charges got something to do with the number of dependents ?

g) Do a similar dependents-charges analysis, Region-wise.

h) Give your understanding from the patterns observed in point (b)

i) Give your interpretation for observations made in point c

2)Create dummy variables in order to proceed with Regression Analysis

3)Perform Multiple Linear Regression Analysis.

Final Interpretation:

1)Smoker, age, BMI have a very strong and direct impact on increasing insurance charges claim.

2)Also a smoker in southeast and southwest region will claim higher charges.

3)If we look at only the region as an independent variable then people from south east and south west region claim lesser charges w.r.t our reference region northeast.

4)Claimants having more no. of children also show higher claims.

Tools Used:

Excel: Pivot table, Charts, Conditional formatting, Data Encoding, ANOVA, Regression Analysis.
